# Hi, I'm emeraldchicago! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! I usually post my links, profiles, articles and other internet-oriented activites here.
Here are some stuff I am doing in my early-teenage years.

## ðŸš€ About Me
- Interests
  - Luau Programming
    - I love Roblox and especially creating experiences. I use Knit by sleitnick as my framework, and I'm loving it!
    - Some of my projects include Tribal Tensions and working in several SCP groups.
  - Political Science
    - Of course, we all know about the major conflicts and game-changing decisions leaders make nowadays. In order to cope with that, I think it would be the best to be a more educated citizen.
    - I am not studying in any political science / philosophy program, I only read books about PS as my way to learn.
  - Debate
    - Debate is an excellent way to improve your critical thinking, and I enjoy deep diving into controversial topics so I could learn more and feed my curiosity!
    - So far I have started this year.
  - Writing / Grammar
    - Writing is one of the most interesting ways to communicate and tell stories and provide information. I take clubs at my school to improve my grammar and writing ability.
  - Gaming
- Habits
  - I usually structure my day, focusing on avoiding any bad habits such as biting my nails and such.
  - I try to be more social. After the pandemic, my social skills have just collapsed on me. To compensate, I try meeting people more and being more friendly.
  - I like to be more efficient with my time and make to-do lists to keep up with time management.
